# Student-monitoring-system
This was a student monitoring system create as a coursework task for university. Uses pandas and Matplotlib

NOTES
* For menu function the best way to use the function is the select option 1 and 2 first that way it registers as it uses the dataset created in option 2 for the rest of the functions.

* For "hardworking_students" the survey asks for the file-path of the survey simply copy and paste the file-path straight from where it is on the computer to the program and it will find it. 

* For clarity the student performance function gives you the option to choose from 1 to 6. 1 is test 1, 2 is test 2, 3 is test 3, and 4 is test 4. Just in case it is confusing. 5 is the formative test, this is further clarified in the program but it will be reiterated in the README file just in case. This format is the same for the dataset containing all of the grades and results for questions, there was a struggle joining the files with there being an issue with duplicate names, to solve this issue, columns were organised with an underscore and a initial which indicated with test the column belonged to for example grade_m is the column that contains the grades for the mock tests. 

* The criteria for underperforming students were students that got less than 10 percent of the average grade for the summative test what is interesting is that it appears that the underperformers' lowest grade tended to be in the first test which may indicate that those that did not do as well were struggling from the start, suggesting that students may need to be checked up on early.
